        <h2 id="world">Trump and top European leader agree to work toward zero tariffs</h2>
        <img src="img/trump.jpg" alt="Trump">
        <p>Washington President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker agreed to work toward eliminating tariffs and barriers on trade, reducing tensions for now in a brewing trade war. It was essentially
            a deal to make a deal, announced in celebratory fashion during an previously unannounced appearance in the White House Rose Garden. Trump declared it a "very big day for free and fair trade" with Juncker by his side. It was a cheery end to
            talks Trump himself suggested this week would be acrimonious. The US and the EU have been lobbing new tariffs on products since Trump announced earlier this year tough new levies on steel and aluminum exports. Recently, Trump has threatened
            a 25% tariff on European autos, a warning that seems to have been staved off. "We agreed today, first of all, to work together toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods," Trump said. Trump
            indicated both sides agreed to halt for now tariffs that threatened to devolve into a trade war as negotiations proceed, and said the EU agreed to import more US soybeans and liquid natural gas.</p>
        <h2>Xi Jinping heads to Africa to clinch China's hold over the continent</h2>
        <img src="img/china.jpg" alt="china$ in africa" width=450 height=400>
        <p>Beijing, China Chinese President Xi Jinping heads to Africa this week as Beijing moves to further cement its role as one of the continent's closest economic and diplomatic allies. After a brief stop in the Persian Gulf Thursday, Xi's itinerary
            -- his first overseas trip since beginning his second term as leader -- takes him to Senegal, Rwanda, South Africa and Mauritius, spanning almost every corner of Sub-Saharan Africa, where China's economic clout, and strategic ambitions, are
            growing by the year. China is Africa's largest trading partner, overtaking the United States nearly a decade ago. Bilateral trade reached a record-high of $220 billion in 2014, official statistics show. Chinese leaders have always made a point
            of visiting African nations regularly and early during their time in power. When he assumed the presidency in 2013, Xi also chose Africa as part of his maiden journey abroad and went on to visit the continent two more times during his first
            term. China's interest in Africa isn't just about trade, the continent also provides a large amount of raw materials which China couldn't get otherwise, while also acting as a pro-China political bloc at the United Nations.</p>
        <h2 id="tech">We took an exclusive ride in a flying car</h2>
        <img src="img/flyingcar.jpg" alt="flyingcar">
        <p>"It's as easy to use as playing Minecraft," Kitty Hawk CEO Sebastian Thrun said as we watched my colleague Rachel Crane pull on a motorcycle helmet. Rachel and I had just flown into Las Vegas for an exclusive first look at the Silicon Valley single-seat
            flying machine, Flyer. Kitty Hawk, funded by Google cofounder Larry Page and led by Thrun, a self-driving car pioneer, attracted nationwide attention when it teased its Flyer prototype last year. But now Rachel was suiting up to become the
            first reporter to take flight in a new, sleeker model -- no pilot license required. Expectedly, she was nervous and I was relieved it wasn't me sitting in the pilot's seat. The 250-pound vehicle resembles a cross between a drone and a pontoon
            plane. Ten propellers twirled around her as I watched from 50 feet away.</p>
        <h2 id="sport">Daniel Ricciardo: 'This year's F1 champion will feel more fulfilled'</h2>
        <img src="img/formula1.jpg" alt="formula1">
        <p> He may be some way off the Championship leaders but Daniel Ricciardo believes this year's F1 title race is the most exciting it's been for years. As the season nears its halfway stage and the teams take a collective deep breath following the sport's
            first-ever triple header, the Red Bull driver finds himself in fourth place, 65 points behind Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel.The Australian knows the odds are firmly stacked against him bridging the gap, particularly when he and teammate Max Verstappen
            "take too many points away from each other." But equally he believes the days of one team dominating are over, and that can only be a good thing for a sport.</p>
        <h2>Liverpool signs Brazilian goalkeeper Alisson from Roma for $84 million</h2>
        <img src="img/goalkeeper.jpg" alt="goalkeeper">
        <p> Brazil international Alisson has joined Liverpool from Roma in an $84 million transfer -- a world record deal for a goalkeeper. "In terms of my life and my career, it's a huge step for me being part of this club and this family," the 25-year-old
            Alisson told the Liverpool website after signing a reported six-year contract. "You can be certain that I'll give my all."The transfer makes the Brazilian the most expensive goalkeeper in history, his fee eclipsing the $62 million Juventus
            paid to Parma in 2001 for Gianluigi Buffon and the $46 million Ederson cost Manchester City from Benfica last summer.</p>
        <h2 id="travel">Photographer Johan Lolos captures Europe's most beautiful mountains</h2>
        <img src="img/mountains.jpg" alt="mountains">
        <p>Europe is home to some incredible landscapes -- from the vast splendor of the Alps to the volcanic terrain of Iceland. These spectacular destinations are just some of the highlights of Johan Lolos' new book "Peaks of Europe" -- a photographic
            essay documenting mountains across his home continent. Belgium-born Lolos has traveled the world, but in 2017 he decided to work a little closer to home. "After three years of intense travel, I just realized that maybe I should try and focus
            more on my own continent," he tells CNN Travel. "Europe had a lot to offer, lots of varied landscapes."</p>
